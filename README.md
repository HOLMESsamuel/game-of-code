# Impossible boxes

This is the source code related to the project submission of team "Hacker vaillant rien d'impossible" for the Game of Code 2022 Hackathon.

## Boxes (processes)
### Data import and conversion box

This is the Java, Maven, Springboot project that can be found under that path:

	/src/main/...
	
together with its pom.xml file in the root.

### Data manipulation box

This is the first part of the Python Jupyter Notebook file:

	unsupervised_learning.ipynb

that can be found in the root.
It is also available in exported form (more readable) as a markdown file, with the same name.
Idem for the following Python Jupyter Notebook files.

### Unsupervised feature scoring box

This is the second part of the Python Jupyter Notebook file:

	unsupervised_learning.ipynb

that can be found in the root.

### Cross-validation box

This is split in the two Python Jupyter Notebook files:

	prepare_csv_data.ipynb
	
	cross-validate.ipynb
